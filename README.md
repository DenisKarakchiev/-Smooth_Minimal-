### Ideology

Don't you tired of all of these 'more colors for the God of colors' themes?
Is they really do their job? Making coding easier? Or you just trying to not to drown in endless colors?

I want to create simple theme that won't confusing you at the start and will highlight only important things. 
It's not finished yet, but i already find it convinient for me to use, so hope it will helps you either.

### Usage

- Press the icon in the right of name of your current color scheme    
- Choose 'import scheme'  
- Select file litydity.jar or litydity.icls and press Apply in settings window   
Here you go!
